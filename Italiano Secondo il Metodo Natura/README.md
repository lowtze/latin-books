This is a Markdown conversion of the scanned PDF of "Italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura" published in 1962 by the Nature Method Centre accessible [here](https://archive.org/details/Litalianoecondoetodoatura).

The first two chapters have also been recorded and uploaded to Youtube by the user Polymathy. Playlist is viewable [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQQL5IeNgck0CP34Z558D2Djkk4poSGOa).

I am learning Italian via this method and transcribing as I go along with plans to eventually produce an EPUB through Pandoc, which will include all illustrations and sidenotes from the book.
