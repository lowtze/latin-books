This is a clean reproduction of Easy Latin Play by M L Newman based on a scanned copy on Archive.org of the 1913 edition. This reproduction intends to keep the spirit of the original and includes cleaned up scans of the original cover included in the book.

There are two versions of the cleaned up copy:

1. "Easy Latin Plays - M L Newman - Macrons" A version containing the macrons as they are in the original book.
2. "Easy Latin Plays - M L Newman - No Macrons" A version without the macrons. Much of Latin literature and texts on offer does not include markings for vowel length. While it is important for the learner to learn vowel length, it is equally important to develop the skill to read and decipher text without them. 

Each version will have a Markdown and Epub copy. The Epub is generated in Calibre directly from the Markdown original. You are welcome to make your own Epub copies using the Markdown and converter of your choice (if they are especially pretty, please let me know so I can link them here!).

Both versions currently do not include the vocabulary sections at the end as these are a nightmare to reformat at the moment. For now, use the indispensible Whitaker's Words to query your vocab: https://latin-words.com/

## To-Do:

- [ ] do a second round of proofing
- [ ] add Epubs
- [ ] reformat and add in the vocabulary sections
