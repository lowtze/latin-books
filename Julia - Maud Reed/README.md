This is a clean reproduction of Julia: A Latin Reading Book by Maud Reed and published through the Macmillan Company based on a scanned copy on Archive.org of the 1941 reprint. This reproduction intends to keep the spirit of the original and includes cleaned up scans of the original cover and illustrations included in the book. I have added footnotes for the sources of the quotes included in the document.

There are two versions of the cleaned up copy:

1. "Julia - Maud Reed - Macrons" A version containing the macrons as they are in the original book. This means that the markings for the first and second declension endings stop around chapter XXVIII and for the third declension after chapter XXX to preserve the purity of the original text. An expanded version that includes macrons throughout can be found here: https://cerclelatin.org/wiki/Reed/julia
2. "Julia - Maud Reed - No Macrons" A version without the macrons. Much of Latin literature and texts on offer does not include markings for vowel length. While it is important for the learner to learn vowel length, it is equally important to develop the skill to read and decipher text without them. 

Each version has a Markdown and Epub copy. The Epub is generated in Calibre directly from the Markdown original. You are welcome to make your own Epub copies using the Markdown and converter of your choice (if they are especially pretty, please let me know so I can link them here!).

Both versions currently do not include the vocabulary sections at the end as these are a nightmare to reformat at the moment. For now, use the indispensible Whitaker's Words to query your vocab: https://latin-words.com/

## To-Do:

- [ ] do a second round of proofing
- [ ] add Epubs
- [ ] reformat and add in the vocabulary sections
