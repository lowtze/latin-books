This is a clean reproduction of Pro Patria by E A Sonnenschein and published through the Macmillan Company based on a scanned copy on Archive.org of the 1910 reprint. This reproduction intends to keep the spirit of the original and includes cleaned up scans of the original cover and illustrations included in the book.

This book is a sequel to "Ora Maritima" by the same author. An audiobook produced by Latinum can be found here: https://latinumpodcast.blogspot.com/2009/12/ora-maritima-latin-story-for-beginners.html

There is one version of the cleaned up copy:

2. "Pro Patria - E A Sonnenschein - No Macrons" A version without the macrons. Much of Latin literature and texts on offer does not include markings for vowel length. While it is important for the learner to learn vowel length, it is equally important to develop the skill to read and decipher text without them. 

Each version has a Markdown and Epub copy. The Epub is generated in Calibre directly from the Markdown original. You are welcome to make your own Epub copies using the Markdown and converter of your choice (if they are especially pretty, please let me know so I can link them here!).

The current version does not include the vocabulary sections at the end as these are a nightmare to reformat at the moment. For now, use the indispensible Whitaker's Words to query your vocab: https://latin-words.com/

## To-Do:

- [ ] do a second round of proofing
- [ ] add Epubs
- [ ] reformat and add in the vocabulary sections
- [ ] remove extra spaces in quotes
