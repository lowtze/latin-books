# scanned-books

A budding repository for OCR-ification of older books, hand tuned, later to be contributed to ongoing projects. Now with only Latin texts!

Initial OCR done by Tesseract using gImageReader: https://github.com/manisandro/gImageReader

Hand corrections and scripted fixes for common issues (formatting, split lines, etc.).

Proofing always welcome. Please pull any typos or incorrect words for merging.

More to come!
